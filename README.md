# eXtreme Diminution (xd)

This project has been created for my studies. I had to write specification of my own extension and implement converter for it (from *.bmp to *.xd and vice versa). It has been written in collaboration with github.com/kucharzyk-sebastian.

My part in this project were: Facade, FileBitStream, ObjectsCreator, Loader, Saver, XdFileReader, XdFileWriter, Cocreation of application's structure.

In this project I have learnt how to buffer data, operate on binary data and I have improved my OOP design.
